      summary: Directory lookup
      description: Optionally, you may choose to host the payment selection on your website and skip the HPP part (directory lookup). Directory lookup enables you to directly show the entry fields for the selected payment methods to shoppers. It sends information such as the shopper location, shopping basket value and currency to the Adyen Payment Platform, which dynamically provides the list of the most relevant payment methods for this shopper to the merchant. By using this payment data, you can dynamically generate a customized payment page allowing the shopper to complete their purchase using a targeted selection of payment methods.  By selecting a payment method, the shopper is redirected to the local payment method check out of his choice, for example the shopper’s own bank iDEAL page, the shopper's own bank Suomen Verkumaksut page, PayPal page, etc. Following any payment request, Adyen sends back a notification providing the status of the payment and updates the status as soon as it changes. This means that our customers receive information about the status of the request in all cases.

      merchantReturnData:
        description: If you define this field in the payment session setup, the value is returned as is. This information is useful to build a custom result page, and it integrates seamlessly with the shopper's session on your server.When the payment status is defined, we send you a server-to-server notification. This notification is the recommended way to update the payment status in your back office. The notification system is more reliable in its delivery because the  resultURL parameter relies on the shopper's browser/computer/Internet connection, any of which could fail at any time. We recommend setting a fixed resultURL in the skin configuration. However, sometimes it may be preferable to set the result URL on a per-payment basis to override the resultURL value specified in the skin configuration, you need to set the result URL for the payment session with the resURL parameter.
